1. Can you identify keywords to which your chatbot responds? 
hello and hi led to a reciprocated greeting
when being mean or rude (using words like stupid or dumb) to the chatbots they are either offended or rude back

2. Think of several keywords and the responses they might cause.
hello - Not many people say hello to robots. I do appreciate it.
how are you - I feel like someone dropped a magnet in my head.
what's your name - I believe very strongly that I am Elbot.
what's your favorite color - My favorite color is metallic infrared.

responses are usually related to the personality of chatbot/ what animal, thing, or person they are
